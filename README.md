# 100 Bytes
100 Bytes WordPress Theme - 100 bytes of CSS to look great everywhere

## About

100 Bytes is a theme that aims to look as optimal as possible to deliver your message to your audience using WordPress as a content manager. 

The idea is simple, make a theme that looks good everywhere, with as little CSS code as possible. In this case the limit is 100 Bytes of CSS information.

Actually the compressed CSS code contains 82 bytes of information, but 100 bytes sounds better.

- No functions or styles for comments.
- No functions or styles for menus.
- Yes styles to read well everywhere.

## Idea

One day this tweet appeared on my Twitter timeline (https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1449472712720601088) and I thought it was interesting to combine it with WordPress.
